You’ve picked the people you hold the most dear to stand beside you. You may have even gotten a cake lined up! Now it’s my privilege to bring your plans together, making your wedding happen with excellence!  This service includes a meeting with you before your wedding day to put together your entire “wedding outline.”  This outline includes ceremony logistics, reception plan, set up/tear down procedures, and more.  I will also plan to run point on the day of the rehearsal so that on the day of the wedding, I will be on point for all transitions, logistics, scheduling specifics, and needs of assistance.  My focus on that day is strictly to assure that your story is shared with truth and beauty.  My promise is to do so with gentleness, kindness, and the upmost desire to serve.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <span className=\"services-header\" >Partial Wedding Planning - </span>You’re on your way to the altar, but would like some support on the way there.  Partial Wedding Planning brings me into the last month or so of your planning.  I will relieve you of “checking the boxes, so to speak.” This includes following up with vendors, last minute decisions on decorations/schedule, and more.  Again, my participation in the Wedding Day will look identical to “Wedding Coordination.”\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <span className=\"services-header\" >Full Wedding Planning - </span> You’ve said YES and you’re getting married! Yay!  This is where I would step in to help you through this wonderfully crazy journey.  This service is a little more unique, in that it would be decided with you, based on the needs and wants you have for your wedding.  Together we will figure out your timeline, book all vendors, create a schedule with deadlines and clear action points, and all the other services given in “Partial Wedding Planning” and “Wedding Coordination”. \r\n                        </p>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n        )\r\n                    \r\n    };\r\n\r\n    export default WeddingsContent;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Header from '../../Header';\r\nimport Footer from '../../Footer';\r\nimport MiniScroller from '../../../features/mini-scroller'\r\nimport WeddingsContent from './WeddingsContent';\r\nimport '../../../styles/WeddingService.css'\r\nclass WeddingService extends React.Component {\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div>\r\n                <Header />\r\n                <WeddingsContent />      \r\n                <MiniScroller />              \r\n                <Footer />\r\n            </div>\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WeddingService;\r\n\r\n\r\n// go to wedding services and fix up the page\r\n// fix footer to have dynamic source"],"sourceRoot":""}
