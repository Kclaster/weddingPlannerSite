Our wedding party, officiant, and family members all received clear direction before, during, and after the ceremony. Her gifts in organization and directing were truly on display throughout the process. Once the cameras were on, she quickly garnered the respect and attention of the entire bridal party. Our wedding and photos went without a hitch, thanks largely to Erin's guidance. Our parents were blessed to simply enjoy the wedding and leave the details to Erin. Throughout the entire day, my thoughts were free from worry, allowing me to enjoy the blessings at hand and the wonderful gift of marriage to my husband.",o="I have seen Erin use her gifts of leadership, delegation, and detail in many different avenues; whether it was organizing my wedding party, a community wide event, or just a game night with friends.

Also, you can't miss it- she brings life to any party!",c="Erin was such a blessing to have during our big weekend. We met with her before the day & ran through everything with her; she has such an eye for detail from past experiences that she was able to ask us questions to help sketch out every little detail of our wedding. Our day went so smooth because of that - we didn't have to worry about anything! Her direct, assertive personality helped corral people during our rehearsal dinner and our wedding day. During our wedding rehearsal, she addressed everybody so that we were all on the same page going into the weekend.

She did a great job of handling my large and boisterous wedding party (9 groomsmen and 9 bridesmaids plus 2 three year olds). Erin came the morning of and handled vendors coming in and doing the final touches on the ceremony set up. It was great having her handle what would be stressful situations for the bride and family. My wedding took place in the same venue as the reception so we knew we needed good leadership to make the flip happen as quickly as possible. Erin handled this with ease and the reception was set up and ready to go before we were done with pictures!
